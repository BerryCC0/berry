# Getting Started with Berry OS

Welcome to Berry OS, a nostalgic recreation of Mac OS 8 for the modern web.

## Navigation

### Desktop
The desktop shows your most-used applications and folders. Double-click to open them.

### Dock
The Dock at the bottom provides quick access to pinned applications. You can customize which apps appear in the Dock through Settings.

### Menu Bar
The Menu Bar at the top shows:
- **Berry Menu**: System controls (About, Sleep, Restart, Shutdown)
- **Active App Menu**: Context-specific options
- **Time & Date**: Current time
- **Wallet**: Connect your wallet to save preferences

## Applications

### Finder
Browse the virtual filesystem. Navigate through folders, view files, and open them with the appropriate applications.

### Calculator
A classic calculator for basic arithmetic operations.

### Settings
Customize your Berry OS experience:
- Appearance (themes, wallpapers)
- Desktop layout
- Dock configuration
- Accessibility options

## Saving Your Preferences

Connect your wallet to save your Berry OS customizations across sessions and devices. Your wallet is only used as an identity key – we never request signatures or access to your funds.

## Tips

1. **Keyboard shortcuts**: Many Mac-like shortcuts work (⌘+W to close, etc.)
2. **Right-click**: Context menus are available on most elements
3. **Window management**: Drag windows by their title bar, resize from corners

Enjoy your trip back to 1997! 🍎
